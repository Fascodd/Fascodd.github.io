11-15-2018: Anything you see on the index.html page at this point is 100% not representative. Still looking to find a good way to go about displaying your art layout wise.

11/16/2018: Made a mockup website layout based on: (https://onlinemediamasters.com/wordpress-themes-for-artists/)-template_3:"PEAK". Still need dynamic functionality for
vertical nav bar (probably need to change them to buttons and give them ids to mactch with img ids for sorting). Need Javascript animastions.
